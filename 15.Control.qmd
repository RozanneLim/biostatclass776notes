## Base R Plots

# lapply()
The lapply() function does the following simple series of operations:
1. it loops over a list, iterating over each element in that list
2. it applies a function to each element of the list (a function that you specify) and returns a list (the l in lapply() is for “list”).

```{r}
#Example
x <- list(a = 1:5, b = rnorm(10))
lapply(x, mean)
```

# sapply() 

```{r}

```
