# Dates and Times
R has developed a special representation of dates and times
• Dates are represented by the Date class
• Times are represented by the POSIXct or the POSIXlt class

## Lubridate
• It largely replaces the default date/time functions in base R
• It contains methods for date/time arithmetic
• It handles time zones, leap year, leap seconds, etc.

```{r}
library("tidyverse")
library("lubridate")
```

## Creating dates and times
There are three types of date/time data that refer to an instant in time:
1. A date. Tibbles print this as <date>.
2. A time within a day. Tibbles print this as <time>.
3. A date-time is a date plus a time: it uniquely identifies an instant in time (typically to the nearest second). Tibbles print this as <dttm>. Elsewhere in R these are called POSIXct.

```{r}
#get the current date
today()
#gets current date and time
now()
#base R get current date
base::Sys.Date()
#base R get current date and time
base::Sys.time()
```

## Typical ways dates and times are created in R
1. From a string
2. From individual date-time components
3. From an existing date/time object

**From a string**
Dates can be coerced from a character strings using some helper functions from lubridate. They automatically work out the format once you specify the order of the component.

```{r}
ymd("1970-01-01")
mdy("January 31st, 2017")
dmy("31-Jan-2017")

#Base R versions
as.Date("1970-01-01")
as.Date("January 31st, 2017", "%B %dst, %Y")
as.Date(gsub("st,", "", "January 31st, 2017"), "%B %d %Y") #need to strip the "st"
```


```{r}
#More than one date!
x <- c(
  "2016-04-05",
  "2016/05/06",
  "2016,10,4"
)
ymd(x)
```

**From individual time-date components**

Example 1: 
```{r}
library("nycflights13")

flights %>%
  select(year, month, day)
```

Using make_date()
```{r}
flights %>%
  select(year, month, day) %>%
  mutate(departure = make_date(year, month, day))
```

Using make_datetime()
```{r}
flights %>%
  select(year, month, day, hour, minute) %>%
  mutate(departure = make_datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute))
```

**From other types**
You may want to switch between a date-time and a date.
That is the job of as_datetime() and as_date():

Examples: 
```{r}
today()
#switching to date-time
as_datetime(today())


now()
#switching to date
as_date(now())
```

## Date-Times in R

To create a date-time from a character string, add an underscore and one or more of “h”, “m”, and “s” to the name of the parsing function:
Times can be coerced from a character string with ymd_hms()
 
 Examples:
 ```{r}
ymd_hms("2017-01-31 20:11:59")
mdy_hm("01/31/2017 08:01")
 ```

 Specifying a timezone: 
 ```{r}
ymd_hms("2016-09-13 14:00:00")
ymd_hms("2016-09-13 14:00:00", tz = "America/New_York")
ymd_hms("2016-09-13 14:00:00", tz = "")
 ```

 ## POSIXct or the POSIXlt class

POSIXct is just a very large integer under the hood. It is a useful class when you want to store times in something like a data frame.

 ```{r}
x <- ymd_hm("1970-01-01 01:00")
class(x)
 ```
